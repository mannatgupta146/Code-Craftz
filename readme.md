# Code Craftz - Responsive Landing Page

**Code Craftz** is a responsive and mobile-first landing page designed to showcase a clean and modern web layout. The page is designed to adjust seamlessly across various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience for users on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: 
    - Displays a logo.
    - Provides navigation links: Store, Courses, Career, Blog, and Account.
    - Includes a mobile-friendly menu icon and a "Sign In" button.
    
- **Content Section**: 
    - A large heading and a short description of the platform.
    - A call-to-action button ("Get Started") to engage users.
    
- **Visual Appeal**:
    - A vibrant coding illustration (`coding.png`) that adds a modern touch to the landing page.
    - The layout is designed to prioritize important elements, ensuring users have a great experience.

- **Mobile-First Design**: 
    - The page is optimized for mobile devices first and scales up gracefully to larger screens.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
    - The page works well across modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Project Setup

Follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mannatgupta146/Code-Craftz.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd code-craftz
    ```

3. **Open the project**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the landing page.
    - Alternatively, use a local server setup to run the project.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: 
    - The page is built with semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and maintainability. 
    - The navigation section includes the logo, menu, and links to different sections.
    
2. **CSS Styles**: 
    - The layout uses `flexbox` to organize content efficiently, ensuring it is both responsive and aligned properly on all screen sizes.
    - A media query is used to handle smaller screens (max-width: 600px), adjusting the display of the navigation bar, buttons, and other elements.
    
3. **Responsive Design**:
    - The media query alters the design by:
        - Hiding navigation items and replacing them with a menu icon for mobile devices.
        - Adjusting font sizes and layout elements for a better mobile experience.

4. **Mobile-First Approach**:
    - The design prioritizes mobile optimization, ensuring the layout adapts to smaller screens first, then adjusts for larger screens.

## Usage

- **For Developers**: 
    - You can modify the existing HTML, CSS, and image files to customize the landing page for your needs.
    - Open `index.html` to see the page in action.
  
- **For Designers**: 
    - Use the provided styles to implement similar designs or adapt them to your own projects.

- **For Content Editors**: 
    - Easily update the text and images in the HTML to reflect your brand, product, or service.
