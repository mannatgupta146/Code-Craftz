# Code Craftz - Responsive Landing Page

**Code Craftz** is a responsive and mobile-first landing page designed to showcase a clean and modern web layout. The page is designed to adjust seamlessly across various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience for users on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: Displays a logo, navigation links (Store, Courses, Career, Blog, Account), a mobile-friendly menu icon, and a "Sign In" button.
  
- **Content Section**: Includes a large heading, a brief description of the platform, and a call-to-action button ("Get Started").
  
- **Visual Appeal**: Features a vibrant coding illustration (`coding.png`) and a layout designed to prioritize important elements for a seamless user experience.

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices and scales up for larger screens.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Project Setup

Follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mannatgupta146/Code-Craftz.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd code-craftz
    ```

3. **Open the project**:
Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the landing page.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: Built with semantic HTML5 elements for accessibility and maintainability. The navigation section includes the logo, menu, and links to different sections.

- **CSS Styles**: Uses `flexbox` for content organization, ensuring the layout is responsive and well-aligned on all screen sizes. A media query adjusts the display for smaller screens (max-width: 600px), modifying the navigation bar, buttons, and other elements.

- **Responsive Design**: The media query modifies the design by hiding navigation items on mobile devices and replacing them with a menu icon. Font sizes and layout elements are adjusted for a better mobile experience.

- **Mobile-First Approach**: The design is optimized for mobile first, ensuring the layout adapts to smaller screens before scaling up for larger screens.

## Usage

- **For Developers**: Modify the existing HTML, CSS, and image files to customize the landing page. Open `index.html` to see the page in action.

- **For Designers**: Use the provided styles to implement similar designs or adapt them to your own projects.

- **For Content Editors**: Easily update the text and images in the HTML to reflect your brand, product, or service.
